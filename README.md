# pleiades-hr: Searching for Croatian place names in Pleiades dataset

Using the CSV dump of Pleiades ancient world data (the table of names in [pleiades-names-latest.csv](http://atlantides.org/downloads/pleiades/dumps/pleiades-names-latest.csv.gz)), we want to see how many Croatian place names there are.

To find out, we are using XQuery and BaseX.
